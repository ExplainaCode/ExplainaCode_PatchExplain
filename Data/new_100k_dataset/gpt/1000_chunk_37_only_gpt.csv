36814,"/** 
 * This method modifies the failure handling of native method resolution by allowing retry with a prefix applied to the name. When used with the  {@link java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer ClassFileTransformer}, it enables native methods to be instrumented. <p/> Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented (they have no bytecodes), they must be wrapped with a non-native method which can be instrumented. For example, if we had: <pre> native boolean foo(int x);</pre> <p/> We could transform the class file (with the ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition of the class) so that this becomes: <pre> boolean foo(int x) { <i>... record entry to foo ...</i> return wrapped_foo(x); } native boolean wrapped_foo(int x);</pre> <p/> Where <code>foo</code> becomes a wrapper for the actual native method with the appended prefix ""wrapped_"".  Note that ""wrapped_"" would be a poor choice of prefix since it might conceivably form the name of an existing method thus something like ""$$$MyAgentWrapped$$$_"" would be better but would make these examples less readable. <p/> The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native method call, but now the problem becomes linking up the wrapped method with the native implementation. That is, the method <code>wrapped_foo</code> needs to be resolved to the native implementation of <code>foo</code>, which might be: <pre> Java_somePackage_someClass_foo(JNIEnv* env, jint x)</pre> <p/> This function allows the prefix to be specified and the proper resolution to occur. Specifically, when the standard resolution fails, the resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration. There are two ways that resolution occurs, explicit resolution with the JNI function <code>RegisterNatives</code> and the normal automatic resolution.  For <code>RegisterNatives</code>, the JVM will attempt this association: <pre>  {@code method(foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)}</pre> <p/> When this fails, the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix prepended to the method name, yielding the correct resolution: <pre>  {@code method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)}</pre> <p/> For automatic resolution, the JVM will attempt: <pre>  {@code method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(wrapped_foo)}</pre> <p/> When this fails, the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name, yielding the correct resolution: <pre>  {@code method(wrapped_foo) -> nativeImplementation(foo)}</pre> <p/> Note that since the prefix is only used when standard resolution fails, native methods can be wrapped selectively. <p/> Since each <code>ClassFileTransformer</code> can do its own transformation of the bytecodes, more than one layer of wrappers may be applied. Thus each transformer needs its own prefix.  Since transformations are applied in order, the prefixes, if applied, will be applied in the same order (see   {@link #addTransformer(ClassFileTransformer,boolean) addTransformer}). Thus if three transformers applied wrappers, <code>foo</code> might become <code>$trans3_$trans2_$trans1_foo</code>.  But if, say, the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to <code>foo</code> it would be just <code>$trans3_$trans1_foo</code>.
